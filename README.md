# Website
This website is generated from Markdown files using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/).

We loosely follow the [Semantic Line Break format](https://sembr.org/) in the source files to keep them readable in-editor.

For special Markdown syntax, see the [Markdown Features section](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features) of the Docusaurus documentation.

### Installation

```shell
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```shell
$ npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```shell
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

It is recommended to run this command at least once before creating a pull request.
This creates a production build, which removes draft pages and has stricter checks for things like broken links and missing images.

To serve the finished build locally, you can run this command:

```shell
$ npm run serve
```
