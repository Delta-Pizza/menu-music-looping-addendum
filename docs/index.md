# Introduction

## Basics

Welcome to the PAYDAY 3 Modding Documentation site!

We are only at the beginning of the life cycle of this game, but it has already been proven that advanced modding is possible.
This documentation will guide you through two ways of modding:

* Using the Unreal Editor, with a template of assets generated from the game
* Using UE4SS, which is mainly a LUA toolkit and runtime property inspector

:::tip

We recommend you join the [ModWorkShop Discord server](https://discord.gg/Eear4JW) for questions and to interact with experienced members of the modding community.
