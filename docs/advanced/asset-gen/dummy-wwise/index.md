# Making dummy Wwise Assets

:::note
Support for dummying Wwise assets is provided by the `DummyFactories` plugin, disabling this plugin will remove the ability to create dummy Wwise assets.
:::

## AkAudioEvent
AkAudioEvents are only really used for heist soundtracks, so there's a high likelihood you won't need to make one as someone would have already made one.

To make a dummy `AkAudioEvent`, do the following:
1. Right-click on the content browser and select `Media` and choose `AkAudioEvent`
2. Name your dummy asset and it's done.
